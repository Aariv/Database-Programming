Getting Started with PostgreSQL
-------------------------------

I assume that you are familiar with SQL commands (such as CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE).

1.  Introduction

PostgreSQL is an open-source Object-Relational Database Management System (ORDBMS). 

It supports a large part of the SQL standards such as foreign keys, triggers, views and transactions; and object-oriented features such as inheritance.

The project started in UC Berkeley in 1986, and is now developed by a group of volunteers called "PostgreSQL Global Development Group".

The mother site for PostgreSQL is http://www.postgresql.org; with manual @ http://www.postgresql.org/docs/manuals/.
